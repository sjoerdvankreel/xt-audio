?, ? - V1.9
* Static link against msvcrt.
* Breaking change (all languages): changed XtOnError signature.
* Breaking change (all languages): removed XtLocation and XtPrintLocation.
* Breaking change (all languages): changed XtAudioInit signature, use XtAudioSetOnError instead.
* Breaking change (native): renamed (lib)xt-core.(dll/so) to (lib)xt-audio.(dll/so).
* Improved error handling (java/C++/.NET): internal assertion failures now throw exceptions instead of calling std::terminate().

January 27, 2021 - V1.8
* Minor bugfixes.
* Switched LGPL to MIT.
* Support nuget and mvn.
* Breaking change (java): changed mvn groupId.
* Breaking change (cli): renamed Xt.Cli.dll to Xt.Audio.dll.

January 2, 2021 - V1.7
* Major cleanup/rewrite/bugfix release.

* New features:
- Query stream state for stopped/running (see XtStreamIsRunning). 
- Get notified when stream stops outside of application's control (see XtOnRunning).
- Querying device name can now be done without opening the device (see the new XtDeviceList API's).
- Service capabilities now correctly indicate whether a service supports stream aggregation (see XtServiceCapsAggregation).
- Service capabilities now correctly indicate whether a service supports device control panels (see XtServiceCapsControlPanel).
- Added access to backend-specific handles (IASIO*, IAudioClient*, snd_pcm_t*, pa_simple* etc). See XtDeviceGetHandle and XtStreamGetHandle.
- Added device capabilities to explicitly test for input/output devices, WASAPI loopback streams and direct-to-hardware access (see XtDeviceCaps).
- Devices are now queried by device id's instead of indices. Device id's are stable across application sessions (see the new XtDeviceList API's).

* Bugfixes:
- ALSA mmapped mode now uses blocking waits.
- ALSA R/W mode now uses implicit start (previously the first buffer would cause an xrun).
- ALSA backed used to call snd_device_name_hint once for each device, is now only done once in XtServiceOpenDeviceList.
- DirectSound would crash in aggregated mode if an xrun occurred on a secondary buffer. This is now reported to the applications OnXRun handler instead.
- ALSA, Pulse, DSound, WASAPI: errors that occurred on the audio thread would crash the process. Instead now the stream is stopped and error reported to XtOnRunning.
- DSound, WASAPI: audio thread now uses a 10 second timeout to wait for buffer to become available. After this, the stream is stopped instead of hanging indefinately.

* New API's
- XtDeviceCaps to test for device specific capabilities
- XtDeviceGetHandle and XtStreamGetHandle to retrieve backend-specific handles
- XtDeviceList, XtServiceOpenDeviceList, XtEnumFlags to query device names and ids
- XtOnRunning and XtStreamIsRunning to check whether stream stopped outside applications control

* Breaking changes (build):
- Dropped support for static linking.
- C++ bindings are now a header-only library.
- Selective compilation support is now opt-in (XT_ENABLE_{BACKEND}) instead of opt-out (XT_DISABLE_{BACKEND}).

* Breaking changes (C++):
- #include <xt/XtAudio.hpp> instead of <xt-cpp.hpp>.

* Breaking changes (C)
- #include <xt/XtAudio.h> instead of <xt-audio.h>.
- Removed XtAudioFree. All returned buffers are now either statically allocated or must be allocated by the caller.
-- See XtDeviceGetChannelName, XtDeviceListGetId, XtDeviceListGetName, XtPlatformGetSystems, XtServiceGetDefaultDeviceId

* Breaking changes (Java and .NET)
- The "raw" parameter to the OpenStream/AggregateStream functions is removed.
- Native buffers is now the default, applications must use the XtSafeBuffer API to use CLR/JVM managed arrays.

* Breaking changes (all languages):
- XtFormat struct changed (grouped channel parameters).
- XtBuffer renamed to XtBufferSize.
- XtXRunCallback replaced by XtOnXRun and signature changed.
- XtStreamCallback replaced by XtOnBuffer and signature changed.
- XtFatalCallback/XtTraceCallback replaced by XtOnError and signature changed.
- Removed XtLevel enum. Only errors are now logged.
- Renamed XtCapabilities to XtServiceCaps (to allow clear distinction with the new XtDeviceCaps).
- Dropped XtErrorGet* functions. Use XtAudioGetErrorInfo instead.
- Optional return values are now handled by an (XtBool* valid) parameter in C, or optional/nullable datatypes in other languages. 
-- See XtServiceGetDefaultDeviceId, XtDeviceGetMix
- XtPrint*ToString functions are renamed to XtPrint*.
- Dropped most XtPrint* functions. Only enums, XtErrorInfo and XtLocation now have print/tostring()/operator<< functions.
- Dropped XtAudioIsWin32.
- XtAudioTerminate replaced by XtPlatformDestroy.
- XtAudioGetVersion now returns a struct.
- XtAudioInit now returns XtPlatform handle.
- XtAudioGetServiceCount/BySetup/ByIndex/BySystem are replaced by the new XtPlatform API's.
- XtAudioGetSampleAttributes now returns struct by value.
- Dropped XtServiceGetSystem/XtDeviceGetSystem/XtStreamGetSystem.
- Dropped XtServiceOpenDefaultDevice. Use XtServiceGetDefaultDeviceId/XtServiceOpenDevice instead.
- XtServiceOpenDevice now opens a device by id instead of by index. See XtDeviceListGetId.
- Parameters to XtServiceAggregateStream are now grouped in a struct (XtAggregateStreamParams params).
- Parameters to XtDeviceOpenStream are now grouped in a struct (XtDeviceStreamParams).
- The audio buffer callback now returns an (u)int value for internal use. Applications must return 0.
- The audio buffer callback no longer receives an error value. Use XtOnRunning instead.
- Dropped XtDeviceGetName. Use XtDeviceListGetName instead.
- Dropped XtStreamIsInterleaved.
